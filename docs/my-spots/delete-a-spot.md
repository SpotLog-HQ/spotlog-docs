# My Spots- Delete A Spot

It is possible to delete a Spot from the my spots screen, simply click the delete icon against the spot you would like to remove. 

<a href="/images/my-spots/my-spots-delete.png" target="_blank">
  <img
    src="/images/my-spots/my-spots-delete.png"
    class="doc-img md"
    alt="SpotLog – Calendar screen"
  />
</a>

You will then be asked to confirm that you are sure you would like to delete the spot. 

<a href="/images/my-spots/my-spots-delete-confirm.png" target="_blank">
  <img
    src="/images/my-spots/my-spots-delete-confirm.png"
    class="doc-img md"
    alt="SpotLog – Calendar screen"
  />
</a>

Clicking delete will remove the spot from SpotLog - this action is not recoverable.
