# Edit a Spot

You can edit any spot to update information, add missing details, or correct mistakes. SpotLog allows unlimited edits to your spots.

<!-- Screenshot: The My Spots list with the edit icon highlighted on a spot -->

## How to Edit

There are two ways to edit a spot:

### From My Spots List (Swipe Action)

1. Find the spot you want to edit in the [My Spots](/my-spots/index) list
2. **Swipe left** on the spot to reveal the action buttons
3. Tap the **Edit** button
4. The edit screen opens with all existing data pre-filled

### From Spot Details

1. Tap on a spot to open its details
2. Tap the **Edit** button
3. The edit screen opens with all existing data pre-filled

## The Edit Screen

The edit screen is the same as the [Detailed Log](/detailed-log/index) screen, but with all your existing data pre-filled. You can:

- Update any field
- Add or remove photos
- Change the date
- Add new information you didn't record originally

## Saving Changes

When you've made your changes, tap **Save** to update the spot. Your original spot is overwritten with the new information.

::: info
SpotLog does not keep a history of changes. Once you save, the previous version is replaced.

## What You Can Edit

All fields are editable:

- Locomotive number and name
- Class and operator
- Date and location
- Photos (add or remove)
- Train details
- Notes
- Everything else from the Detailed Log

## Tips

- Use edit to add details to Quick Spots later
- Add photos after the fact if you forgot during initial logging
- Correct typos in locomotive numbers or names
