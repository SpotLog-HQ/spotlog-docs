# Delete a Spot

You can delete any spot you no longer want to keep. Headcode always asks for confirmation before deleting to prevent accidental data loss.

## How to Delete

There are two ways to delete a spot:

### From My Spots List (Swipe Action)

1. Find the spot you want to delete in the [My Spots](/android/my-spots/index) list
2. **Swipe left** on the spot to reveal the action buttons
3. Tap the **Delete** button
4. Confirm the deletion when prompted

<a href="/images/android/delete-spot-action.png" target="_blank">
  <img
    src="/images/android/delete-spot-action.png"
    class="doc-img md"
    alt="Headcode – Calendar screen"
  />
</a>

### From Spot Details

1. Tap on a spot to open its details
2. Tap the **Delete** button
3. Confirm the deletion when prompted

## Confirmation

When you tap delete, Headcode shows a confirmation dialog:

<a href="/images/android/delete-spot.png" target="_blank">
  <img
    src="/images/android/delete-spot.png"
    class="doc-img md"
    alt="Headcode – Calendar screen"
  />
</a>

- Tap **Delete** to permanently remove the spot
- Tap **Cancel** to keep the spot

## What Gets Deleted

When you delete a spot:

- The spot record is removed from Headcode
- All photos attached to that spot are deleted
- The spot no longer appears in your statistics

::: danger
Deleting a spot is permanent and cannot be undone. Make sure you have a [backup](/android/settings/import-export/export-full) if you want to preserve your data.

## Deleting All Spots

If you want to delete all your spots at once, use the [Delete All Spots](/android/settings/delete-all-spots) option in Settings. This is useful if you want to start fresh.
