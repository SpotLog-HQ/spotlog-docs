# Filtering

Filters help you find specific spots from your collection. Whether you're looking for all spots at a particular location or want to see everything from a specific date range, filters make it easy.

  />
</a>

## Opening the Filter Panel

  />
</a>

## Available Filters

### Date Range

Filter spots by when they were recorded:

- **Start Date** - Only show spots from this date onwards
- **End Date** - Only show spots up to this date

This is useful for finding spots from a particular trip or event.

### Location

Enter a location name to show only spots recorded at that place.

### Locomotive Number

Filter by a specific locomotive number or headcode.

### Locomotive Name

Filter by locomotive name (e.g., "Flying Scotsman").

### Class

Filter by locomotive class (e.g., "66", "A4").

## Applying Filters

Once you've entered your filter criteria:

1. Tap **Apply Filters** to see matching spots
2. The My Spots list updates to show only spots matching your criteria

  />
</a>

## Combining Filters

You can use multiple filters at once. For example:

- All Class 66 spots at York
- All spots from January 2024 with "Flying Scotsman"

Filters are combined using "AND" logic - spots must match all criteria you specify.

## Clearing Filters

To remove filters and see all your spots again:

1. Open the filter panel
2. Tap **Clear Filters** or remove the values from each field
3. Tap **Apply Filters**

## Tips

- Use filters when you have many spots and want to find something specific
- For quick text searches, the [Search](/android/getting-started/searching) screen may be faster
- Filters persist until you clear them, so remember to clear them when done
