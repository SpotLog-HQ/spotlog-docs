# Export as CSV

Export your spot data as a CSV (Comma-Separated Values) file that can be opened in spreadsheet applications like Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, or Numbers.

## What's Included

The CSV export includes all text data from your spots:

- Locomotive number and name
- Class and operator
- Date and time
- Location
- Notes
- Train details (ECS, accompanied, carriage count)
- Onboard information (departure/arrival stations)

::: info

## Using Your CSV

Once exported, you can:

- Open in a spreadsheet app to view and analyse your spots
- Create charts and graphs of your spotting activity
- Share with friends
- Keep as a simple backup of your spot data
- Import into other applications

## CSV Format

The file uses standard CSV format with:
- Headers in the first row
- One spot per row
- Comma-separated values
- UTF-8 encoding for special characters

## Tips

- CSV export is quick even with many spots (no photos to process)
- Great for creating personal statistics beyond what Headcode shows
- Can be used to create custom reports of your spotting activity
