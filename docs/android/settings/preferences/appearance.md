# Appearance

Customise how SpotLog looks by choosing your preferred theme.

## Changing the Theme

Tap on the **Theme** option to cycle through the available options:

### Follow System

SpotLog will match your device's theme setting. When your phone is in dark mode, SpotLog will be dark. When it's in light mode, SpotLog will be light.

This is the default setting and is recommended for most users.

### Light Mode

Forces SpotLog to always use the light theme, regardless of your device settings. The interface will have a bright background with dark text.

### Dark Mode

Forces SpotLog to always use the dark theme, regardless of your device settings. The interface will have a dark background with light text.

Dark mode is easier on the eyes in low-light conditions and may help conserve battery on devices with OLED screens.
