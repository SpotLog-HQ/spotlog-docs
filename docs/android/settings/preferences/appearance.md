# Appearance

Customise how Headcode looks by choosing your preferred theme.

<!-- Screenshot: The Appearance section in Settings showing the theme selector -->

## Changing the Theme

Tap on the **Theme** option to cycle through the available options:

### Follow System

Headcode will match your device's theme setting. When your phone is in dark mode, Headcode will be dark. When it's in light mode, Headcode will be light.

This is the default setting and is recommended for most users.

### Light Mode

Forces Headcode to always use the light theme, regardless of your device settings. The interface will have a bright background with dark text.

### Dark Mode

Forces Headcode to always use the dark theme, regardless of your device settings. The interface will have a dark background with light text.

Dark mode is easier on the eyes in low-light conditions and may help conserve battery on devices with OLED screens.
