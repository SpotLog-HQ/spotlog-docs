# Delete All Spots

This option allows you to completely clear your Headcode data and start fresh. Use this if you want to begin again with an empty app.

::: danger
This action permanently deletes **all** your spots and photos. It cannot be undone. Make sure to [create a backup](/android/settings/import-export/export-full) first if you want to keep your data.
:::

<!-- Screenshot: The Delete All Spots option in the Settings screen -->

## What Gets Deleted

When you delete all spots:

- All your spot records
- All attached photos
- Your statistics (which are derived from spots)

Reference data (locomotive details, classes, locations, operators) is **not** deleted - only spots and photos.

## How to Delete

1. Go to **Settings > Data Management**
2. Tap **Delete All Spots** (this option is disabled if you have no spots)
3. A confirmation dialog appears
4. Tap **Delete** to confirm

<!-- Screenshot: The confirmation dialog asking "Delete All Spots? This is irreversible" -->

## Confirmation

Headcode requires explicit confirmation before deleting your data. You'll see a warning dialog explaining that this action cannot be undone.

## After Deletion

Once deletion is complete:

- The My Spots list will be empty
- Statistics will show no data
- The Gallery will be empty
- The Calendar will show no spots

Headcode will confirm how many spots and photos were deleted.

## Data Recovery

::: warning
The Headcode support team **cannot** recover deleted data. All your data is stored locally on your device, so once deleted, it's gone forever.
:::

**Before deleting**, consider:

- Creating a [Full Backup](/android/settings/import-export/export-full)
- Exporting to [CSV](/android/settings/import-export/export-as-csv) for a spreadsheet record
- Saving your [photos](/android/settings/import-export/export-photos)
