# Getting Started

Welcome to Headcode, the mobile app designed for train enthusiasts who want to log their locomotive sightings quickly and easily.

This section will help you get up and running with Headcode, covering the main features and how to use them. If you can't find what you're looking for, feel free to drop us an [email](mailto:support@Headcode.app) and we'll do our best to help you out.

## What is Headcode?

Headcode is a train spotting companion app that allows you to:

- **Quick Log** sightings with minimal effort
- **Add detailed information** including photos, location, and train details
- **View statistics** about your spotting activity
- **Browse your spots** in calendar and gallery views
- **Search** through all your recorded sightings
- **Track achievements** and level up as you spot
- **Export and backup** your data

All your data is stored locally on your device, so Headcode works perfectly offline.

## App Navigation

Headcode uses a bottom navigation bar to help you move between the main sections:

- **Quick Log** - The home screen for fast spot entry
- **Stats** - View your spotting statistics and trends
- **Calendar** - See your spots organised by date
- **Gallery** - Browse all your spot photos
- **Search** - Find specific spots quickly
