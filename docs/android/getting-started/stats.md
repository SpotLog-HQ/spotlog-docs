# Statistics

The Stats screen gives you insights into your spotting activity. All statistics are calculated from your recorded spots, so the more you log, the more interesting your stats become.

## Spot Streak

At the top of the Stats screen, you'll see your current spot streak. This shows how many consecutive days you've been recording spots.

The streak card also displays your activity for the current week, with a checkmark for each day you've logged at least one spot. Keep your streak going by spotting every day!

Below the streak, you'll find four summary cards showing key metrics:

- **Total Spots** - The total number of spots you've recorded
- **Unique Locomotives** - How many different locomotives you've seen
- **Photos Taken** - The total number of photos attached to your spots
- **Most Active Year** - The year in which you recorded the most spots
