# Detailed Log

The Detailed Log screen lets you record comprehensive information about a spot. While the [Quick Log](/android/getting-started/quick-log) is perfect for fast entries, the Detailed Log is for when you want to capture everything about a sighting.

## When to Use Detailed Log

Use the Detailed Log when you want to record:

- Full locomotive and train details
- Where exactly you saw the train
- Whether you were onboard
- Photos of the locomotive
- Notes and observations

## Accessing Detailed Log

You can access the Detailed Log in two ways:

1. **After a Quick Spot** - When prompted "Would you like to add more details?", tap Yes
2. **By editing an existing spot** - From [My Spots](/android/my-spots/index), tap the edit icon on any spot

## How It Works

The Detailed Log screen is organised into expandable sections. Tap on any section header to expand it and enter information. All fields are optional, so you only need to fill in what's relevant.

When you're done, tap the **Save** button at the bottom of the screen.
