# Detailed Log - Photos

This section allows you to add photos to your spot. Photos help you remember your sightings and create a visual record of your spotting adventures.

  />
</a>

## Multiple Photos

You can add multiple photos to a single spot. This is useful when you've taken several shots of the same locomotive or want to capture different angles.

  />
</a>

## Viewing Attached Photos

Once photos are attached, they appear as thumbnails in the Photos section. Tap any thumbnail to view it full-screen.

## Saving Your Spot

When you tap **Save**, your photos are automatically stored within Headcode. They're copied to the app's storage, so you can safely delete them from your device's gallery if needed.

## Photo Reminder

If you save a detailed spot without adding any photos, Headcode will ask if you meant to add photos. This is a helpful reminder in case you forgot.

  />
</a>

::: tip
You can disable this reminder in [Settings > Preferences > Reminders](/android/settings/preferences/reminders).

## Where Photos Appear

Your spot photos appear in several places:

- **Spot Details** - The main photo displays as a hero image at the top, with a gallery of all photos below
- **Gallery** - All your spot photos are accessible from the [Gallery](/android/getting-started/gallery) tab
- **My Spots list** - Spots with photos show a small photo indicator

## Photo Storage

Photos are stored locally on your device. You can export them using the [Export Photos](/android/settings/import-export/export-photos) feature in Settings.
