# Delete a Spot

You can delete any spot you no longer want to keep. SpotLog always asks for confirmation before deleting to prevent accidental data loss.

## How to Delete

There are two ways to delete a spot:

### From My Spots List (Swipe Action)

1. Find the spot you want to delete in the [My Spots](/ios/my-spots/index) list
2. **Swipe left** on the spot to reveal the action buttons
3. Tap the **Delete** button
4. Confirm the deletion when prompted

### From Spot Details

1. Tap on a spot to open its details
2. Tap the **Delete** button
3. Confirm the deletion when prompted

## Confirmation

When you tap delete, SpotLog shows a confirmation dialog:

- Tap **Delete** to permanently remove the spot
- Tap **Cancel** to keep the spot

## What Gets Deleted

When you delete a spot:

- The spot record is removed from SpotLog
- All photos attached to that spot are deleted
- The spot no longer appears in your statistics

::: danger
Deleting a spot is permanent and cannot be undone. Make sure you have a [backup](/ios/settings/import-export/export-full) if you want to preserve your data.

## Deleting All Spots

If you want to delete all your spots at once, use the [Delete All Spots](/ios/settings/delete-all-spots) option in Settings. This is useful if you want to start fresh.
