# Detailed Log - Location Seen

This section lets you record where you spotted the locomotive. Recording locations helps you track your favourite spotting locations and contributes to the "Hot Spots" section on your [Stats](/ios/getting-started/stats) screen.

## Entering a Location

Simply type the name of the location where you saw the locomotive. This could be:

- A station name (e.g., "Paddington", "York")
- A level crossing or bridge name
- A depot or yard name (e.g., "Toton TMD")
- Any other recognisable location

## Auto-Suggestions

As you type, Headcode will suggest locations you've used before. This helps you maintain consistent naming for your regular spotting locations.

## Tips

- Use consistent naming for the same location to ensure accurate statistics
- You can manage your saved locations in [Settings > Reference Data](/ios/settings/reference-data/locations)
- This field is optional - leave it blank if you don't want to record a location
