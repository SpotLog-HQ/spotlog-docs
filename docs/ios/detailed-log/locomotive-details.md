## Available Fields

### Locomotive Number / Headcode

The primary identifier for the locomotive. This is usually the running number (e.g., "66018") or headcode for passenger services (e.g., "1Z10").

### Locomotive Name

The named identity of the locomotive, if it has one (e.g., "Flying Scotsman", "Mallard").

### Class

The locomotive class designation (e.g., "66", "A4", "57"). When you start typing, Headcode will suggest classes you've used before.

### Operator

The train operating company or heritage railway operating the locomotive (e.g., "GBRf", "DB Cargo", "SVR").

### Locomotive Type

Choose from:
- **Diesel** - Diesel-powered locomotives
- **Electric** - Electric locomotives
- **Steam** - Steam locomotives
- **DMU** - Diesel Multiple Units
- **EMU** - Electric Multiple Units

### Condition

Record the visual condition of the locomotive:
- **Clean** - Recently cleaned or well-maintained
- **Weathered** - Showing signs of wear
- **Dirty** - Covered in brake dust or grime

### Tender First

This option only appears when Locomotive Type is set to **Steam**. Toggle this on if the locomotive was running tender-first (bunker first for tank engines).
