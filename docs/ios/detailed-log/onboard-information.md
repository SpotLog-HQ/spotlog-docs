# Detailed Log - Onboard Information

This section lets you record details about your journey if you were onboard the train. Whether it's a heritage railway trip or a charter excursion, you can log where you joined and left the train.

## Marking a Spot as Onboard

Toggle the **Onboard** switch to indicate that you were travelling on this train. When enabled, additional fields appear to record your journey.

## Available Fields

### Departure Station

The station where you boarded the train. This could be:
- A mainline station (e.g., "London Victoria")
- A heritage railway station (e.g., "Bridgnorth")

### Arrival Station

The station where you left the train or the final destination of your journey.

## When to Use This

Use the Onboard section when:

- You took a ride on a heritage railway
- You travelled on a charter or railtour
- You were onboard any train hauled by a locomotive you're spotting

## How It Appears

When you view the [Spot Details](/ios/my-spots/spot-details), spots marked as onboard will show a "Journey" section displaying your departure and arrival stations.
