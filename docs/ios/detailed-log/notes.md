# Detailed Log - Notes

This section allows you to add free-form notes to your spot. Notes are perfect for recording anything that doesn't fit into the other fields.

<!-- Screenshot: The Notes section showing the text input area -->

## What to Include in Notes

Use notes to record:

- Special observations about the locomotive
- Working details (e.g., "Running light engine to Crewe")
- Weather conditions
- Who you were with
- Memorable moments from the sighting
- Any other details you want to remember

## Searching Notes

Your notes are included in the [Search](/ios/getting-started/searching) function, so you can find spots later by searching for words you've written in your notes.

## How Notes Appear

When you view a spot's details, notes are displayed in their own card at the bottom of the screen, making them easy to read and reference.
