## Available Fields

### Number of Carriages

Enter the number of carriages or coaches in the train formation. This is useful for recording:

- Heritage railway train lengths
- Charter train consists
- Regular service formations

When you view the [Spot Details](/ios/my-spots/spot-details), trains with carriage counts will show a visual "Formation" section displaying the number of coaches.

### ECS (Empty Coaching Stock)

Toggle this on if the train was running as Empty Coaching Stock. ECS movements are when trains move without passengers, typically:

- Positioning moves to/from depots
- Stock transfers between locations
- Post-service movements to stabling points

### Accompanied

Toggle this on if the locomotive was double-headed or accompanied by another locomotive. This is common on:

- Heritage railway gala events
- Charter trains
- Locomotive positioning moves
