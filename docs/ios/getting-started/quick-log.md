# Quick Log

The Quick Log screen is the first screen you see when SpotLog opens. It's designed for speed, allowing you to record a sighting in just a few seconds.

  />
</a>

## How to Log a Spot

1. Enter the **locomotive number** or headcode in the text field
2. Optionally add a **locomotive name** if you know it
3. Tap the **Log** button to save your spot

That's it! Your spot is now recorded with today's date and time.

## Adding Photos

You can attach photos to your spot directly from the Quick Log screen.

1. Tap the **camera icon** next to the input field
2. Select one or more photos from your device's gallery
3. The selected photos will be attached to your spot when you tap Log

  />
</a>

## New Locomotive Prompt

When you log a locomotive that you haven't seen before, SpotLog will ask if you'd like to add more details about it.

    src="/images/ios/quick-log-new-loco.png"
    class="doc-img md"
    alt="SpotLog – Calendar screen"
  />
</a>

Tapping **Yes** will take you to the [Locomotive Details](/ios/settings/reference-data/locomotive-details) screen where you can add technical information like build year, weight, and other specifications. This information will then appear whenever you view spots for that locomotive.

Tapping **No** will simply save the spot without adding extra locomotive data.

## Add More Details

After saving a Quick Spot, SpotLog will ask if you'd like to record more detailed information.

<a href="/images/ios/quick-log-more-details.png" target="_blank">
  <img
    src="/images/ios/quick-log-more-details.png"
    class="doc-img md"
    alt="SpotLog – Calendar screen"
  />
</a>


Tapping **Yes** will take you to the [Detailed Log](/ios/detailed-log/index) screen where you can add:

- Location information
- Train details (carriages, ECS status)
- Onboard journey information
- Notes
- Additional photos

Tapping **No** will keep your spot as a quick entry.

::: tip
You can disable this prompt in [Settings > Preferences > Reminders](/ios/settings/preferences/reminders) if you prefer not to be asked each time.
