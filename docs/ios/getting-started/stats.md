# Statistics

The Stats screen gives you insights into your spotting activity. All statistics are calculated from your recorded spots, so the more you log, the more interesting your stats become.

- **Unique Locomotives** - How many different locomotives you've seen
- **Photos Taken** - The total number of photos attached to your spots
