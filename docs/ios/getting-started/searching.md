# Searching

The Search screen lets you quickly find specific spots from your collection. Whether you're looking for a particular locomotive or trying to remember where you saw something, search makes it easy.

  />
</a>

## How to Search

1. Tap the **search bar** at the top of the screen
2. Type your search term
3. Results appear automatically as you type

## What You Can Search For

Headcode searches across multiple fields in your spots:

- **Locomotive Number** - Search by the loco number or headcode (e.g., "66018", "1Z10")
- **Locomotive Name** - Search by name (e.g., "Flying Scotsman", "Mallard")
- **Location** - Search by where you spotted it (e.g., "Paddington", "York")
- **Class** - Search by locomotive class (e.g., "66", "A4")
- **Notes** - Search through your spot notes

</a>

## Viewing Search Results

Search results appear as a list of matching spots. For each result, you can see:

- The locomotive number and name
- The date of the spot
- Location (if recorded)

Tap any result to open the full [Spot Details](/ios/my-spots/spot-details) screen.

## Tips for Better Searches

- **Partial matches work** - Searching "66" will find all Class 66 locomotives
- **Case doesn't matter** - "mallard" and "Mallard" give the same results
- **Be specific if needed** - If you have many spots, use more specific terms to narrow down results
