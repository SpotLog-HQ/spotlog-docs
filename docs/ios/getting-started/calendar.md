# Calendar

The Calendar screen displays your spots organised by date in a monthly calendar view. It's a useful way to remember when and where you went spotting.

  <img
    src="/images/ios/calendar.png"
    class="doc-img md"
    alt="SpotLog – Calendar screen"
  />
</a>

## Navigating the Calendar

- **Swipe left or right** to move between months
- Days with spots are marked with a number showing how many spots you recorded that day
- The current day is highlighted

## Viewing Spots for a Day

Tap on any date to see the spots you recorded on that day. The spots appear in a list below the calendar.

  <img
    src="/images/ios/calendar-selected.png"
    class="doc-img md"
    alt="SpotLog – Calendar screen"
  />
</a>

From the spot list, you can:

- **Tap a spot** to open its [Spot Details](/ios/my-spots/spot-details) screen
- See a preview of the locomotive number, name, and date for each spot

## Understanding the Calendar

- Dates with spots show a small badge with the spot count
- Empty dates have no indicator
- This helps you quickly identify your most active spotting days
