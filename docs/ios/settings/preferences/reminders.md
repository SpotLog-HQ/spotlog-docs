# Reminders

Headcode includes helpful prompts to encourage you to capture more detail. If you prefer a more streamlined experience, you can disable these reminders here.

<!-- Screenshot: The Reminders section in Settings showing the toggle options -->

## Available Reminders

### Photo Reminder

When enabled, Headcode will prompt you if you save a detailed spot without attaching any photos. This is a helpful reminder in case you meant to add a photo but forgot.

**Toggle off** if you:
- Rarely take photos of your spots
- Prefer to add photos later
- Find the prompt disruptive to your workflow

### Quick Spot Detail Prompt

When enabled, after saving a Quick Spot, Headcode asks if you'd like to add more details. Tapping "Yes" takes you to the Detailed Log screen.

**Toggle off** if you:
- Always use Quick Spots for fast, minimal entries
- Prefer to edit spots later rather than immediately
- Find the prompt slows down your spotting

## Default Settings

Both reminders are **enabled by default** to help new users discover Headcode's full capabilities. Once you're comfortable with the app, you can adjust these to match your preferred workflow.

## Tips

- Try using Headcode with reminders on for a while to see if they're helpful
- You can always add details or photos later by [editing a spot](/ios/my-spots/edit-a-spot)
- These settings don't affect [notification reminders](/ios/settings/preferences/notifications)
