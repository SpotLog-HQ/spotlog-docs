# Import Your Data

If you've previously exported your data from SpotLog or are moving to a new device, you can restore your spots by importing a backup file.

<!-- Screenshot: The Import/Export screen showing the Import option -->

## What You Can Import

SpotLog can import data from a **full backup** file (`.zip`) that was previously created using the [Full Export](/settings/import-export/export-full) feature.

The import includes:
- All your spots
- All attached photos
- Reference data (locomotive details, classes, etc.)

## How to Import

1. Go to **Settings > Import / Export**
2. Tap **Import / Restore**
3. Select your backup file (`.zip`) from your device
4. Wait for the import to complete

## Important Notes

::: warning
Importing data will **replace** your current SpotLog data. Make sure to export a backup of your current data first if you want to keep it.
:::

- Only import files that were exported from SpotLog
- The import process may take some time if you have many photos
- Make sure your device has enough storage space for the imported photos

## Transferring to a New Device

To transfer your SpotLog data to a new device:

1. On your **old device**: Use [Full Export](/settings/import-export/export-full) to create a backup
2. Transfer the `.zip` file to your new device (via cloud storage, email, or cable)
3. On your **new device**: Install SpotLog and use Import to restore

## Troubleshooting

If import fails:
- Ensure the file is a valid SpotLog backup (`.zip` format)
- Check you have enough storage space
- Try exporting and importing again from the source device
