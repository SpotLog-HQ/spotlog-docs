# Export Photos

Export all your spot photos as a single `.zip` file. This is useful if you want to back up just your photos or use them outside of SpotLog.

<!-- Screenshot: The Import/Export screen showing the Export Photos option -->

## What's Included

The photo export contains all images you've attached to your spots. The photos are exported in their original quality.

::: info
This export includes **only photos**, not spot data. If you want a complete backup including spot details, use [Full Export](/ios/settings/import-export/export-full) instead.
:::

## How to Export

1. Go to **Settings > Import / Export**
2. Tap **Export Photos Only**
3. Wait while SpotLog gathers your photos
4. Choose where to save the `.zip` file

## Export Time

The export may take a while if you have many photos. The more photos and the larger they are, the longer the export will take. Keep the app open during the process.

## Using Your Photos

Once exported, you can:

- Keep as a photo backup separate from SpotLog
- Share photos with friends and fellow enthusiasts
- Use in other applications
- Print or create albums
- Post on social media

## Photo Organisation

Photos are exported with their original filenames, which include timestamps. This helps you identify when each photo was taken.
