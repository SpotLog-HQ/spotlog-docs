# Full Backup

Create a complete backup of your Headcode data, including all spots, photos, and reference data. This is the best way to protect your data and transfer it to a new device.

<!-- Screenshot: The Import/Export screen showing the Full Export option -->

## What's Included

A full backup contains everything:

- All your spots with complete details
- All attached photos
- Reference data (locomotive details, classes, locations, operators)
- App settings

The backup is saved as a `.zip` file that can be used to [restore your data](/ios/settings/import-export/import) later.

## How to Export

1. Go to **Settings > Import / Export**
2. Tap **Full Export**
3. Wait while Headcode creates the backup
4. Choose where to save the `.zip` file

<!-- Screenshot: Progress indicator showing the export in progress -->

## Export Time

The export process may take some time depending on:
- How many spots you have
- How many photos are attached
- The size of your photos

For large collections, the export might take a few minutes. Keep the app open during the process.

## Backup Recommendations

::: tip
Create regular backups to protect your data! We recommend:
- Exporting before updating Headcode to a new version
- Keeping backups in cloud storage (iCloud, Google Drive, etc.)
- Creating a backup before deleting any data
:::

## Using Your Backup

Your backup file can be used to:

- **Restore on the same device** - If something goes wrong
- **Transfer to a new device** - When upgrading phones
- **Keep a safe copy** - Store in cloud storage for peace of mind

To restore from a backup, see [Import Your Data](/ios/settings/import-export/import).
