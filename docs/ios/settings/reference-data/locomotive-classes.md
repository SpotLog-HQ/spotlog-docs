# Locomotive Classes

Manage the locomotive class designations used in SpotLog. Classes are suggested when you're logging a spot, making it faster to enter consistent data.

<!-- Screenshot: The Locomotive Classes list showing various classes -->

## What Are Classes?

Classes are standard designations for groups of similar locomotives, such as:

- **66** - Class 66 freight locomotives
- **A4** - LNER A4 Pacific steam locomotives
- **390** - Pendolino electric multiple units

Using consistent class names helps with searching and statistics.

## How Classes Are Added

Classes are added to SpotLog in two ways:

1. **Automatically** - When you enter a new class while logging a spot, it's saved for future use
2. **Manually** - You can add classes directly in Reference Data

## Viewing Classes

Go to **Settings > Reference Data > Locomotive Classes** to see all classes you've used.

## Adding a New Class

1. Tap the **+** button
2. Enter the class designation
3. Tap **Save**

The new class will now appear in suggestions when logging spots.

## Editing a Class

1. Find the class in the list
2. Tap the **pencil icon**
3. Update the class name
4. Tap **Save**

::: info
Editing a class name here does **not** update existing spots. It only changes the suggestion for future spots.
:::

## Deleting a Class

1. Find the class in the list
2. Tap the **bin icon**
3. Confirm the deletion

Deleting a class removes it from suggestions but does not affect existing spots.

## Tips

- Use official class designations for consistency
- Keep class names concise (e.g., "66" not "Class 66")
- Classes appear as auto-suggestions when you start typing in the class field
