# Operators

Manage train operating companies and heritage railways. Operators are suggested when you're logging a spot, making it faster to enter consistent data.

<!-- Screenshot: The Operators list showing various operators -->

## What Are Operators?

Operators are the companies or organisations that run trains, such as:

- **GBRf** - GB Railfreight
- **DB Cargo** - Deutsche Bahn freight operator
- **LNER** - London North Eastern Railway
- **SVR** - Severn Valley Railway (heritage)
- **NRM** - National Railway Museum

## How Operators Are Added

Operators are added to Headcode in two ways:

1. **Automatically** - When you enter a new operator while logging a spot, it's saved for future use
2. **Manually** - You can add operators directly in Reference Data

## Viewing Operators

Go to **Settings > Reference Data > Operators** to see all operators you've used.

## Adding a New Operator

1. Tap the **+** button
2. Enter the operator name
3. Tap **Save**

The new operator will now appear in suggestions when logging spots.

## Editing an Operator

1. Find the operator in the list
2. Tap the **pencil icon**
3. Update the operator name
4. Tap **Save**

::: info
Editing an operator name here does **not** update existing spots. It only changes the suggestion for future spots.
:::

## Deleting an Operator

1. Find the operator in the list
2. Tap the **bin icon**
3. Confirm the deletion

Deleting an operator removes it from suggestions but does not affect existing spots.

## Tips

- Use standard abbreviations where they're widely recognised (e.g., "GBRf" not "GB Railfreight")
- For heritage railways, you might include the type (e.g., "SVR" or "Severn Valley Railway")
- Keep operator names consistent across your spots for better searching
