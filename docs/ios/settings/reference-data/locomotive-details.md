# Locomotive Details

Locomotive Details lets you store technical specifications for individual locomotives. This information appears on the [Spot Details](/ios/my-spots/spot-details) screen, enriching your sighting records with data about the locomotive itself.

<!-- Screenshot: The Locomotive Details list showing several locomotives -->

## How It Works

When you log a spot for a locomotive you haven't seen before, SpotLog can prompt you to add details about that locomotive. This creates a reference entry that will be shown whenever you view spots for that locomotive.

## Viewing Locomotive Details

Go to **Settings > Reference Data > Locomotive Details** to see all locomotives with reference data.

Each entry shows:
- Locomotive number
- Locomotive name (if set)

## Available Technical Details

For each locomotive, you can record:

- **Build Year** - When the locomotive was built
- **Built By** - Manufacturer (e.g., "Crewe Works", "Swindon")
- **Power Type** - Type of propulsion (Steam, Diesel, Electric)
- **Wheel Configuration** - Wheel arrangement (e.g., "4-6-2", "Co-Co")
- **Designed By** - Designer's name or company
- **Length** - Overall length
- **Weight** - Operating weight
- **Pressure** - Boiler pressure (for steam locomotives)

## Editing Locomotive Details

1. Find the locomotive in the list
2. Tap the **pencil icon**
3. Update any fields you wish

The updated information will appear on all spots for this locomotive.

## Adding a New Locomotive

Locomotives are typically added automatically when you log your first spot for them. However, you can also add locomotive details manually if you want to pre-populate information.

## Deleting Locomotive Details

1. Find the locomotive in the list
2. Tap the **bin icon**
3. Confirm the deletion

::: info
Deleting locomotive details only removes the technical specifications. Your spots for that locomotive are not affected - they'll just show without the "Technical Specifications" section.

## How Details Appear

When viewing a spot for a locomotive with reference data, you'll see a "Technical Specifications" card showing all the recorded details.
