# Import Your Data

One of the features of SpotLog is that we allow you to maintain your own data, if you have previously exported your data from SpotLog, here you can re-import it into the application.

<a href="/public/images/settings/settings.png" target="_blank">
  <img
    src="/public/images/settings/settings.png"
    class="doc-img md"
    alt="SpotLog – Calendar screen"
  />
</a>

To do this you will need to have a SpotLog zip file, you can then use that to re-import your data into SpotLog.

  <img
    src="/public/images/settings/settings-import.png"
    class="doc-img md"
    alt="SpotLog – Calendar screen"
  />
</a>
