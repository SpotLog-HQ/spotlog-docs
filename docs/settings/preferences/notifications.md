# Notifications

SpotLog can send you reminder notifications to help you keep up with your spotting. This is especially useful if you want to maintain a streak or simply don't want to forget to log your sightings.

<!-- Screenshot: The Notifications section in Settings showing the enable toggle and options -->

## Enable Notifications

Toggle **Enable notifications** to turn spot reminders on or off.

When you first enable notifications, SpotLog will ask for permission to send notifications. You'll need to allow this in your device's settings for reminders to work.

## Inactivity Reminder

This setting controls how many days of no spotting activity will trigger a reminder.

<!-- Screenshot: The inactivity threshold picker showing options from 1-14 days -->

Choose from:
- 1 day
- 2 days
- 3 days
- 5 days
- 7 days (1 week)
- 14 days (2 weeks)

For example, if you set this to 3 days and don't log any spots for 3 days, SpotLog will send you a friendly reminder.

## Notification Window

Control when notifications can be sent to avoid being disturbed at inconvenient times.

<!-- Screenshot: The notification window picker showing start and end time -->

Set your preferred window by choosing:

- **Start time** - Earliest time notifications can be sent
- **End time** - Latest time notifications can be sent

Notifications will only be sent within this window. For example, setting 09:00 to 21:00 means you won't receive notifications during the night.

## How It Works

SpotLog looks at when you last logged a spot. If the time since your last spot exceeds your inactivity threshold and it's within your notification window, you'll receive a gentle reminder to go spotting.

## Tips

- Set a shorter threshold (1-2 days) if you're trying to build a streak
- Use a longer threshold (7-14 days) if you only spot occasionally
- Adjust the notification window to match your active hours
- If notifications aren't working, check your device's notification settings for SpotLog
