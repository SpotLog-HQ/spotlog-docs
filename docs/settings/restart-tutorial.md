# Restart Tutorial

When SpotLog first loads up after installation a series of tutorial prompts will be shown throughout the application, these can be easily dismissed but there might be a case where they were dismissed but still required. 

Within the settings SpotLog has an option that allows for these tutorials to be restarted.

    class="doc-img md"
    alt="SpotLog – Calendar screen"
  />
</a>

Clicking the restart tutorial button will show a small prompt, clicking `Restart` will show the tutorials when the application next starts.
