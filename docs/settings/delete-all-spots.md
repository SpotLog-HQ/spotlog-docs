# Delete All Spots 

We have included a destructive feature within the SpotLog application that allows you to 'start fresh', should you ever want to totally wipe the SpotLog database and start spotting from a clean slate this is the option you should use. 

**WARNING** - This is non recoverable, if you have not made a [full backup](/settings/import-export/export-full.md) your data will be totally destroyed once this option is selected. 

Once you click the option to delete all your spot data, you will be shown a final warning before the action is completed.

  <img
    src="/images/settings/settings-delete-all.png"
    class="doc-img md"
    alt="SpotLog – Calendar screen"
  />
</a>

Once you agree and click `Delete` all data within the application will be removed, including any photos that were both linked and unlinked from spots. 

The support team will be _unable_ to recover this data, it lives soley on the device so once it is gone, it is gone.
