# Locomotive Details

When you add a new Spot that contains a locomotive you have never seen before, SpotLog will create an entry in the reference data for that locomotive, this will allow you to add more details for each locomotive that will then appear on the Spot Detail screen when viewing a spot that contains that locomotive.

    class="doc-img md"
    alt="SpotLog – Calendar screen"
  />
</a>

Each locomotive that exists within the Locomotive Details Reference Data is shown in a list, simillar to the My Spots list. 

## Editing a Locomotive

Clicking the pencil icon will take you to the edit details screen for that locomotive.

    class="doc-img md"
    alt="SpotLog – Calendar screen"
  />

Here you can add more information for things like weight and boiler pressure.

## Deleting a Locomotive

It is also possible to delete reference data for a given locomotive, to do that simply click the delete icon for that locomotive entry

<a href="/images/settings/reference-data/locomotive-details-2.png" target="_blank">
  <img
    src="/images/settings/reference-data/locomotive-details-2.png"
    class="doc-img md"
    alt="SpotLog – Calendar screen"
  />
</a>

You will be shown a warning to make sure that you actually want to delete that entry.

<a href="/images/settings/reference-data/locomotive-details-delete-confirm.png" target="_blank">
  <img
    src="/images/settings/reference-data/locomotive-details-delete-confirm.png"
    class="doc-img md"
    alt="SpotLog – Calendar screen"
  />
</a>

If you click `Delete` the locomotive reference data will be removed from the application, this will not affect any of your existing Spot data but that locomotive will no longer show with additional details on the Spot Details screen.
