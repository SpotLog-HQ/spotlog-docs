# Locations

Manage your saved spotting locations. Locations are suggested when you're logging a spot, helping you maintain consistent naming for your favourite spotting spots.

<!-- Screenshot: The Locations list showing saved locations -->

## Why Use Locations?

Using consistent location names helps you:

- Get accurate "Hot Spots" statistics
- Search for spots at specific locations
- Remember your regular spotting locations

## How Locations Are Added

Locations are added to SpotLog in two ways:

1. **Automatically** - When you enter a new location while logging a spot, it's saved for future use
2. **Manually** - You can add locations directly in Reference Data

## Viewing Locations

Go to **Settings > Reference Data > Locations** to see all your saved locations.

## Adding a New Location

1. Tap the **+** button
2. Enter the location name
3. Tap **Save**

The new location will now appear in suggestions when logging spots.

## Editing a Location

1. Find the location in the list
2. Tap the **pencil icon**
3. Update the location name
4. Tap **Save**

::: info
Editing a location name here does **not** update existing spots. If you want consistent naming across all spots, you'll need to edit those spots individually.
:::

## Deleting a Location

1. Find the location in the list
2. Tap the **bin icon**
3. Confirm the deletion

Deleting a location removes it from suggestions but does not affect existing spots.

## Tips

- Use consistent, recognisable names (e.g., "York Station" not "York" one time and "York Railway Station" another)
- Include platform numbers if you regularly spot from specific platforms
- Consider abbreviations for frequently used locations
