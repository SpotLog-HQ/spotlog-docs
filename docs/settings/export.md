One of the features of SpotLog is that we allow you to maintain your own data, you can take it with you at any point in time, to do this you can export the data from within the app to your device.

# Export Your Data

<a href="/images/settings/settings.png" target="_blank">
  <img
    src="/images/settings/settings.png"
    class="doc-img md"
    alt="SpotLog – Calendar screen"
  />
</a>

Exporting your data can be done in one of two ways

1. If you would just like the textual data inputted into SpotLog, you can use the *Export CSV* option.
2. If you would like the textual data and photos you can export the full SpotLog database.

    src="/images/settings/settings-import-export.png"
    class="doc-img md"
    alt="SpotLog – Calendar screen"
  />
</a>
