# Gallery

The Gallery screen displays all the photos you've attached to your spots in one place. It's a visual way to browse through your train spotting memories.

<!-- Screenshot: The Gallery screen showing a grid of spot photos -->

## Browsing Photos

Photos are displayed in a grid layout, sorted with the most recent photos first. The gallery uses a masonry-style layout to make the best use of screen space.

Tap any photo to open it in full-screen view.

## Full-Screen Viewer

When you tap a photo, it opens in the full-screen photo viewer. From here you can:

- **Swipe left or right** to move between photos
- **Pinch to zoom** in and out on the photo
- **Tap the back button** to return to the gallery

## Photo Actions

Long-press on any photo in the gallery to see available actions:

- **View parent spot** - Opens the Spot Details screen for the spot this photo is attached to
- **Delete this photo** - Removes the photo from the spot (you'll be asked to confirm)

<!-- Screenshot: The photo actions sheet showing "View parent spot" and "Delete this photo" options -->

::: warning
Deleting a photo removes it from SpotLog permanently. This action cannot be undone.

## Empty Gallery

If you haven't added any photos to your spots yet, the Gallery will show a message prompting you to add photos. You can add photos when creating a [Quick Spot](/getting-started/quick-log) or a [Detailed Spot](/detailed-log/photos).
