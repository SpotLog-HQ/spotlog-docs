# Achievements

SpotLog includes an Achievements and Levels system to help you track your spotting progress. As you log spots, add photos, and record detailed information, you'll earn XP and unlock achievements.

<!-- Screenshot: The Achievements screen showing the level summary and achievement cards -->

## Accessing Achievements

Tap the **trophy icon** in the app bar (between Search and Settings) to open the Achievements screen.

## Your Level

At the top of the Achievements screen, you'll see your current level and XP progress. As you earn XP from logging spots and unlocking achievements, you'll progress through levels.

### How Levels Work

- You start at **Level 1**
- Each level requires more XP than the last (100 XP × current level)
- There's no maximum level - keep spotting to keep progressing!

## Earning XP

You earn XP (Experience Points) by:

| Action | XP Earned |
|--------|-----------|
| Log a spot | +5 XP |
| Add a photo to a spot | +3 XP |
| Add detailed info to a spot | +5 XP |
| Unlock an achievement | Varies |

## Achievements

Achievements are goals you can unlock through your spotting activity. Each achievement shows:

- An icon representing the achievement
- The achievement name and description
- A progress bar showing how close you are to unlocking it
- Whether it's locked or unlocked
